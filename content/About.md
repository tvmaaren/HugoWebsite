I am a member of the species homo sapiens. I was born on 19 december 2002 in Nieuwegein and have been alive ever since. This website will function as the place where I will put stuff when I feel like it. My e-mail address is thomas.v.maaren@outlook.com, so you can contact me there. Here are some things that I might write about on this website

- Mathematics (Maybe I will publish notes of the course I take)
- My adventures (Reports of cycling trips or hiking trips)
- Whatever pops up in my mind (If I have a thought that I want to write down I might publish it here)
- Computer stuff

This website might seem quite dull in appearance, but I don't care. For now I would rather have a lot of content on my website. After that I can worry about making it look good.
