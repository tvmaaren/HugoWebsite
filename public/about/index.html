Here are some things that I might write about on this website

Mathematics (Maybe I will publish notes of the course I take)
My adventures (Reports of cycling trips or hiking trips)
Whatever pops up in my mind (If I have a thought that I want to write down I might publish it here)
Computer stuff

This website might seem quite dull in appearance, but I don&rsquo;t care. For now I would rather have a lot of content on my website. After that I can worry about making it look good.">
